# Customer-Segmentation
This is my complete project on Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering. This was my first unsupervised learning project. I initially studied about K-means through Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I learned about the "Elbow Method" to select the the number of clusters which is what I have implemented in my project. I have also made a visual to see the clusters along with the respective cluster centers.
